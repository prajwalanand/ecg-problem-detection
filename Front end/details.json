	"Arrhythmia": "Arrhythmia, Dysrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, is a group of conditions in which the heartbeat is irregular, too fast, or too slow. Other symptoms may be light-headedness, passing out, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Treatments may include medications, medical procedures such as a pacemaker, and surgery.",
	"Ischemia": "Ischemia is a restriction in blood supply to tissues, causing a shortage of oxygen that is needed for cellular metabolism (to keep tissue alive). Ischemia is generally caused by problems with blood vessels, with resultant damage to or dysfunction of tissue.  Ischemia comprises not only insufficiency of oxygen, but also reduced availability of nutrients and inadequate removal of metabolic wastes.",
	"Heart Attack": "A heart attack occurs when a blood clot completely blocks the flow of blood and seriously reduces blood flow to the heart muscle. This also results in patients experiencing chest pain. As a result, some of the heart muscle starts to die. The longer the blockage is left untreated, the more the heart muscle is damaged. If the blood flow is not restored quickly, the damage to the heart muscle is permanent."
